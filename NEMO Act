 
The Never Endanger My Ocean Act
Mayoral Legislation of Los Santos

Purpose:

To establish a defined set of boundaries as to what is acceptable while recreationally or commercially fishing in Los Santos. To verify proper equipment, regulations, and limitations, and to establish clearly defined container limits for any given fishing session.

Guidelines:

Article 1: Fishing Requirements
1.	Any person fishing recreationally or commercially is required to have an up-to-date and valid fishing license.
2.	A fishing license must be obtained from the San Andreas Park Rangers by completing a fishing course. Refer to the “L.E.A.R.N. Act”.

Article 2: Designated Fishing Areas
1.	Fishing shall only be allowed in specified areas. Fishing in a non-designated fishing area is prohibited and may lead to prosecution. While fishing, these areas are defined on your fishing map and are color-coded in blue. Fishing outside of these areas will be considered illegal, and violators will be prosecuted. Your fishing license may be subject to revocation for violation of this decree.

Article 3: Designation of Endangered and Invasive Species.
1.	Endangered Species: Any species of fish or animal that has been classified as overfished or overhunted and in need of protection as designated by the City Council at the advice of the Park Rangers.
a.	Endangered species shall be classified as “protected,” and shall be illegal to harvest within the State of San Andreas.
b.	Endangered Species:
■	Dolphin
■	Shark
■	Snapping Turtle
2.	Invasive Species: Any species of fish or animal that has been classified as invasive and/or unnatural and in need of harvest, as designated by the City Council at the advice of the Park Rangers.
a.	Invasive species must be kept when harvested and not released back into the environment. This type of species does not count towards any subsequently set container limits.
b.	Invasive Species:
■	Jellyfish (Any Color)

Article 4: Approved Fishing Gear
1.	Three fishing rods are acceptable for catching fish: Basic Fishing Rod, Sport Fishing Rod, and Professional Fishing Rod. Fishing with something other than what is mentioned may lead to prosecution.
2.	All fish and invasive species must be stored in a Fish Cooler when transporting.
3.	All fish and invasive species must be stored in an Aquarium when being stored indoors.

Article 5: Responsible Harvesting
1.	Any species harvested by anything other than what is listed in Article 5, Section 1 is prohibited. All fish must be caught ethically with any of the listed fishing rods and harvested professionally.

Article 6: Fishing Cooler Limit
1.	Fish Cooler limits for any given session of fishing will be 72 fish per person. Having more than 72 fish on your person or in your vehicle, or the two combined amount, will be considered a violation, and the person(s) in violation will be issued a citation.
2.	If transporting fish with more than one person in a vehicle, the fish cooler limit will be raised to 72 fish per person times the number of people in the vehicle. If there are four people in the vehicle, that means there can be a total of 288 fish between all four people and the vehicle combined. Exceeding the fish cooler limit will result in a felony charge.

Article 7: Fish Tagging
1.	Until there is some form of harmless tagging system, there shall be no “registry” for any fish within the state. If at such time a tagging system can be implemented, registration of a fish or animal shall require no fees or dues and shall be publicly recorded by the City Council and managed by the Park Rangers.

 
Article 8: Revocation of a Fishing License
1.	Any of the above violations that result in a license revocation will result in a mandatory 7-day waiting period before you can reapply for a fishing license. Before obtaining your fishing license, you will need to attend a fishing course, which will be held by the San Andreas Park Rangers as per Article 1, Section 2.

Article 9: Fishing Inspection
1.	All individual participants in fishing, defined as (a) being in a fishing area, and (b) actively having a fishing rod in the water, whether correct or incorrect, to fish, shall be subject to fish cooler limit inspections as defined in Article 5. Only the San Andreas Park Rangers can conduct these searches.
