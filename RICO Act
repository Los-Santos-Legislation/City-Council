 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act
Council Legislation of Los Santos
Preamble
This statute outlines the legal framework under which the State of San Andreas may pursue criminal enterprises operating as structured organizations. The purpose of this law is to deter long-term, coordinated criminal activity while safeguarding individuals from unjust prosecution and ensuring fairness in both investigative conduct and legal consequence.

Legal Foundation
The RICO statute is modeled after federal anti-racketeering laws and applies to criminal organizations that engage in a pattern of organized unlawful acts. It empowers the Department of Justice to take action against criminal networks that act collectively in pursuit of illicit power or financial gain, while upholding due process and procedural oversight.

Legislative Summary
The RICO Act gives law enforcement and the Department of Justice the power to investigate and charge criminal organizations that operate in a structured, coordinated way. To file RICO charges, at least six people must be knowingly involved in the same criminal enterprise with evidence of organized planning, leadership, and profit-driven illegal activity.
RICO investigations must be authorized by the Police Commissioner and built on strong evidence, including organizational structure, surveillance, and proof of crimes tied to financial gain. Any suspects must be notified within 72 hours of a related warrant and are entitled to legal defense and trial. RICO cannot be used to mass-charge groups or seize unrelated property—it must be specific, fair, and follow due process. All filings are reviewed by a Judge before they can be enforced.
This law helps dismantle major criminal networks while protecting individual rights and preventing abuse of power.________________________________________
